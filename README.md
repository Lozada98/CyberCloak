CyberCloak: Tool to Change MAC Address

Description
CyberCloak is a tool developed in Python that allows you to change the MAC address of a network interface on a system. The MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to the network interface of a device and is used for communication on a network. Changing the MAC address can provide some level of anonymity and security, as it can make it more difficult to track a device on a network.

Key Features:

--> Changes the MAC address of a specific network interface.
--> Automatically detects the operating system and uses appropriate commands to perform the action on different platforms.
--> Uses classes and exception handling for a more organized structure and improved error handling.
--> It can be containerized with Docker to facilitate its distribution and execution in different environments.

Use and Example:
--> Requirements
--> Have Python installed.
--> (Optional) Have Docker installed if you prefer to run in a container.
--> Clone the Repository


Bash:
python3 mac_changer.py -i ethe0 -m 30:ee:19:bb:82:b3


Bash:
Run in a Docker container -->

sudo docker run -it mac_changer -i ethe0 -m 30:ee:19:bb:82:b3


Uses in Cybersecurity

Anonymity on Networks:
Changing the MAC address can make it more difficult to track a device on a network, providing a degree of anonymity.

Penetration Testing:
In penetration testing, changing the MAC address can be useful to avoid detection and tracking of devices on the target network.

Security at Public Access Points:
In environments with public access points, changing the MAC address can help protect the device's identity and reduce exposure to potential threats.

Cybersecurity Education:
The program can be used for educational purposes to understand how MAC addresses work and how they can be modified for various purposes.

It is important to note that changing the MAC address may have legal and ethical implications, and its use must comply with applicable laws and policies.
